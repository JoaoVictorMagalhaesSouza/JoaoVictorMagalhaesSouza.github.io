                Hello, welcome to my page. I'm bachelor in Computer Science at Federal University of Viçosa (UFV) - Brazil since July/2022. My main area
                of study is Data Science, Machine Learning and Cloud Computing, always seeking to build practical, intelligible and efficient solutions. 
                On the right, I present a little more about some artifacts produced during this learning journey.

            <h3>ANIN: Investment Analisys Environment</h3>
                <p id="jobText">
                    The purpose of this project is create an environment that can help the beginning investor to make more assertive decisions in their investments. The main idea is 
                    to create a Machine Learning model capable of predicting the closing price of a stock on the Brazilian Stock Exchange 1 day in advance.
                    Under the guidance of Dr. <a href="https://fsbmat-ufv.github.io/" target="_blank">Fernando de Souza Bastos</a>, we create this project by following the following steps:
                    
                </p>
                <ul style="text-align: justify;">
                    <li><b>Constructing the Data Lifecycle:</b> in this point, we refer specifically to the acquisition, treatment, exploratory analysis and feature engineering steps;</li>
                    <li><b>Building Model:</b> here, our focus is to build an robust XGBoost model capable of making acceptable predictions of the closing price in advance;</li>
                    <li><b>Implementing Markowitz Theory:</b> we also implement the Efficient Portfolio Theory that presents the investor with the highest percentage of return on an investment portfolio for a given level of risk;</li>
                    <li><b>Creating of User Interfaces:</b> for the creation of the interfaces, we used the Shiny package of the R language for the production of the environments, although all part of Machine Learning is implemented in the Python language; </li>
                    <li><b>Disclosure of Environment:</b> aiming at the free distribution and use of our environment for all interested parties, we created a containerized application with Docker and deployed it in a Google Cloud service.</li>
                </ul>

                In addition, we published this work in an international journal (IRJAES) with a high impact factor (7,132) due to the innovative proposal of the project and the excellent results achieved.

            <h3>Flask Application for Bitcoin Estimator</h3>
            <p id="jobText">
                This project is the result of a work from the Machine Learning Engineering discipline, offered at the Federal University of Viçosa during graduation. The goal was to build a predictive application that used real-time data.
                The pipeline followed to create this application was:
            </p>
                <ul style="text-align: justify;">
                    <li><b>Data Acquisition;</b></li>
                    <li><b>Data Preprocessing;</b></li>
                    <li><b>Feature Engineering;</b></li>
                    <li><b>Comparative study and implementation of models;</b></li>
                    <li><b>Creating the Flask application;</b></li>
                    <li><b>Containerizing the Flask Application and Deploying to Google Cloud;</b></li>

                </ul>
                <p id="jobText">
                The main objective that was to learn how to manipulate some cloud resources was satisfactorily met, although the metrics of the predictor models for Bitcoin are not so good.
